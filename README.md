# Robot-Gladiators
This is my second project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I will learn to implement JavaScript into an HTML file to create a web application. In this application, users will be able to customize and fight robot gladiators to the death, trying to earn the highest score.
