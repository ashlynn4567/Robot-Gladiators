# Robot-Gladiators

### Fight! Fight! Fight!

Do you like testing your skills and strategical decision-making? Do you like battle-royale, one takes all stakes? Do you like... robots?

Then Robot Gladiators is the game for you! Introducing our new JavaScript-coded browser game that allows you to name your own Robot Gladiator and face randomized opponents until you either die or are the last one standing. In between rounds, you have the option to stop at the shop to either top off your health or upgrade your attack. Choose your tools wisely - for each of these actions costs you precious gold. At the end of the game, you are scored on how much money you have left remaining - if your robot is still left standing. 

Afterwards, the high score is recorded. Try to earn the top spot by giving it your all in the arena!

## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to completely revamp this project. I love the idea of coding a video game, especially one that makes the user apply strategic reasoning to earn the high score. I would like to add the following improvements:

- The alert boxes have to go. They tend to be more disruptive than anything. It would be fantastic if I could make this a full-on web game. I could add some styling to the page, and/or dynamically created robot icons. I would like to make it so that the user could see these robots moving, or "fighting" after each battle action. 
- The page could refresh between "phases." For example, the fight/battle "phase" could be held on one page, while the shop is on another. 

I'm a big believer in always refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the following links.
